							<p>Research on satellite image processing has over 20 years
								history. Simple neural network structure with only fully
								connected layers has been used as a satellite image classifier
								early in 1995. In addition, methods other than neural networks are still
								being used for specific tasks. Statistical methods like
								contrast statistical analysis (CSA), singular value
								decomposition (SVD), temporally contiguous robust
								matrix completion (TECROMAC) and non-additive
								entropy has been used for quality evaluation, image
								de-noising, matrix completion, image classification and
								segmentation. Other than these, multi-class
								SVMs has also been adopted to classify the airborne sensor data,
								in conjunction with a few other methods such as discriminant analysis, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron neural network.
								Multi-label classification can be seen as a related problem to image segmentation,
								where the classes of detected image segments become labels of the image. 
								A key aspect of the problem of labeling satellite imagery
								involves dealing with correlated labels. 
								Multi-label classification has been extensively studied, and a few types of
								approaches dominate.</p>

								Multi-label classification
								can be interpreted as a ranking problem, where the authors combine a ranking objective with a
								convolutional neural network to beat prevalent benchmarks.
								Recent work has demonstrated the possibility of using Recurrent Neural Networks coupled with Convolutional
								Neural Networks for multi-label image annotation, using
								approaches that can be compared to the task of image captioning. In recent years, especially since 2015,
								training a deep neural network becomes easier with larger
								computational power, bigger training datasets and better
								image quality. Thus, convolutional neural network has
								become a popular tool for satellite image analysis in many
								areas of application, including image classification, land
								use classification, pattern detection in urban
								environment, solar power plant detection,
								orthoimagery segmentation, nighttime sky/cloud
								segmentation and face-like structure detection.
								Also, with the emergence of large dataset with
								high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) imagery, different
								neural network models have been created and tuned for
								higher accuracy. Examples models such as traditional
								neural network, deep convolutional neural network,
								multi-channel pulse coupled neural network (m-PCNN)
								and recurrent neural network, have all been used to
								achieve a high accuracy on high-resolution satellite images.
								For this project, I will mainly evaluate the performance of
								deep convolutional neural networks on high-resolution
								Amazon satellite images.

							<p>There are two common loss functions for multilabel
                                classification – sigmoid cross entropy loss and support
                                vector machine (SVM) with hinge loss. 
                                As this is a multi-label classification problem, the primary loss used during training is binary / sigmoid cross-entropy. This
                                loss optimizes the performance for each class independently.
                            </p>

                                Previous research typically uses coarse resolution images to study changes in rainforest, which is not enough
                                for small-scale deforestation. Now we are provided with
                                a high resolution dataset of the whole Amazon landform
                                from the satellite.
                                This is a subset of the general classification problem,
                                which has been massively discussed in the context of not
                                only image processing, but also machine learning and
                                even deep learning. Methods either suitable for general classification problems such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), or specifically designed for image related
                                problems such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
                                can be employed directly. However, different from the traditional binary classification problem, here one image from
                                the satellite can belong to multiple classes. Therefore, to
                                correctly classify each image becomes challenging.
                                In our project, we implement three algorithms to tackle
                                this problem: (1) Different Layers configurations of a commonly used CNN structure (2) VGG-16
                                (3) and ResNet.

							which contains 40479 labeled satellite images and there are 17 classes. 
							These classes address different aspects of the image content, for example, atmospheric conditions and land cover / user.  
							In the training dataset, the labels or classes are not evenly distributed. There are two types of images, JPG and TIF. 
							Both JPG and TIF images are 256x256 pixels. The JPG images have 3 channels - Red, Green, and Blue. 
							The TIF images have 4 channels - Red, Green, Blue, and IR.  The labels have significant correlations. 
							For example, every image has exactly one atmospheric condition label from among clear, haze, partly cloudy and cloudy. 
							Labels like “habitation” tend to occur with other markers of human activity. “Cultivation” and “agriculture” don’t co-occur in images.</p>
